1. As a user, I must be able to log into the system using an email and a password.
2. As a user, I must be able to register on the platform. For this, it will only be necessary to
enter a username and password.
3. As a user, I must be able to upload a CSV file for processing. At the time of uploading
the file, the user must choose which column belongs to which specific contact
information, i.e. the user must match the columns of the file with the information to be
processed and then save it into the database. This means that in the CSVs the columns
with information will not be standard and may arrive in a different order or with different
names than the ones that will be used in the database.
4. The following values must be saved in the database:
- Name
- Date of Birth
- Phone
- Address
- Credit Card
- Franchise
- Email
5. As a system, I must process the content of the CSV file. The following validations must
have the elements in the CSV file
- Name: Names with special characters, except for the minus(-) will be invalid
values and cannot be saved.
- Date of Birth: The system will only accept two types of ISO 8601 date formats
(%Y%m%d ) and (%F). Any date that does not have these formats will not be
saved. At the end, the date must be displayed in the following format Year Month
Day i.e. 1985 January 4.

Telephone: Valid phone formats are (+00) 000 000 00 00 00, for example (+57)
320 432 05 09. And (+00) 000-000-00-00, for example (+57) 320-432-05-09. Any
number that does not comply with this format should be ignored.
Address: for the address there’s nothing to validate other than it’s not empty.
Credit Card: With the credit card two processes must be done. The first one is to
obtain the franchise to which it belongs. For this we must use the IIN with the
card numbers as explained here. In the table below you can see examples for
each franchise in place. The second process is to encrypt the credit card number.
For this you must validate that the length of the card is the corresponding for the
franchise and then encrypt the number with a method that is not recoverable. You
must remember that at the moment of showing the card on the final screen you
must only show the last 4 numbers.

Franchise: The franchise must be identified from the credit card number.
Email: must have a valid email format and it can’t be repeated per associated
account. This means that user A can have a contact example@gmail.com and
user B can have the same contact example@gmail.com but neither user A nor B
can have two contacts with the same email address repeated.
Note that all columns are required

6. As a user, I should be able to see a summary of the contacts I have imported. All
contacts that I have imported and that were successfully created should be displayed in
a list that is paginated.
7. As a user, I should be able to see a log of the contacts that could not be imported and
the error associated with it.
8. As a user, I should be able to see a list of imported files with their respective status. Valid
statuses include: On Hold, Processing, Failed, Terminated.
The statuses are described as follows:

On Hold: the file has been uploaded but has not yet started processing.
Processing: the file is actually being read and performing the actions required
above
Failed: not a single contact could be imported due to data errors (If the contact
file is empty it should not be considered as failed).
Finished: the whole file has been processed and at least one contact has been
registered in the database.
9. BONUS: Upload the processed files to a bucket in S3 and associate an access link
to the file in the system.
10. BONUS: Process the CSV file in a background job.
